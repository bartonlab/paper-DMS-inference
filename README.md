# Contents

Scripts for generating and analyzing the simulation data can be found in the `WF_Simulation.ipynb` notebook. Scripts for processing and analyzing the deep mutational scanning data are contained in the `MPL_inference.ipynb` notebook. Finally, scripts for analysis and figures contained in the manuscript are located in the `figures.ipynb` notebook.  

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by the interim analysis of deep mutational scanning data, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/7917326#.ZFu4j-xKjzc). Then download and extract the contents of the archives into the directory `./epistasis_inference/`.


# MPL

This repository includes codes for inferring selection coefficients using the marginal path likelihood (MPL) method. Codes implementing MPL in python3 and C++ are located in the `src` directory.

### Software dependencies

Parts of the analysis are implemented in C++11 and the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). 

Download Eigen package with this [link](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip) to access to the C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. Make sure that we are using the version of 3.4.0. Unzip the directory under ./epistasis_inference/. 

Figures reproduction requires one external package `logomaker` from PyPI using the pip package manager by executing the following at the commandline: `pip install logomaker`

### Epistasis inference: 
1. open the terminal and open the directory `cd ./epistasis_inference/`
2. enter the command line `g++ -std=c++11 -lgslcblas -lgsl -I ./eigen-3.4.0/ get_freq.cpp -o get_freq`
3. enter the command line `./get_freq`
4. enter the command line `g++ -std=c++11 -lgslcblas -lgsl -I ./eigen-3.4.0/ inversion.cpp -o inversion`
5. enter the command line `./inversion`
