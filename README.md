# Contents

Scripts for generating and analyzing the simulation data can be found in the `WF_Simulation.ipynb` notebook. Scripts for processing and analyzing the deep mutational scanning data are contained in the `MPL_inference.ipynb` notebook. Finally, scripts for analysis and figures contained in the manuscript are located in the `figures.ipynb` notebook.  

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by the interim analysis of deep mutational scanning data, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/XXXXX). Then download and extract the contents of the archives `XXXX` into the folders `data/XXXX` respectively.


# MPL

This repository includes codes for inferring selection coefficients using the marginal path likelihood (MPL) method. Codes implementing MPL in python3 and C++ are located in the `src` directory.

### Software dependencies

Here's an example statement about the need for external software to execute any part of the code: Parts of the analysis are implemented in C++11 and the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

Figures reproduction requires one external package `logomaker` from PyPI using the pip package manager by executing the following at the commandline: `pip install logomaker`
