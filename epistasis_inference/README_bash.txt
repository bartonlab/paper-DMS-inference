The following instruction is coorporated with the example of the replicate #1 of YAP1 as the target protein.

To use the epistasis inference, open the terminal and locate in the directory cd ./epistasis_inference/ to access the pipeline codes.

Then enter the command line g++ -std=c++11 -lgslcblas -lgsl -I ./eigen-3.4.0/ get_freq.cpp -o get_freq to compile the C++ script about freqeucny extraction from the raw data files. To collect intermediate frequency data files, by entering the command line with ./get_freq [Target-protein] [genoype counts data file name] [target protein indexing file name] [raw sequence file], which in this analysis is ./get_freq YAP1 ../output/epistasis/YAP1_haplotype_count_rep1.csv index_matrix.csv ./YAP1_Reference_AA_sequence.txt. This step will output several allele frequency files, such as [Target-protein]_freq_[replicate num]_[generation_num].csv and [Target-protein]_multiple_allele_[replicate_num]_[generation_num].csv within the same directory you executed the ./get_freq command line.

After all, the internediate allele frequencies data files would be proceeded by matrix manipulation codes. First, compling the inversion.cpp by enetering the following command line in the terminal within the directory of ./epistasis_inference/: g++ -std=c++11 -lgslcblas -lgsl -I ./eigen-3.4.0/ inversion.cpp -o inversion, then with which enter the following execution line: ./inversion [Target-protein] [genoype counts data file] [target protein indexing file name] [raw sequence file] [regularization magnitude]. In this analysis, it's ./inversion YAP1 ../output/epistasis/YAP1_haplotype_count_rep1.csv index_matrix.csv ./YAP1_Reference_AA_sequence.txt 100

Finally, you will have the output [Target_protein]_epistasis_rep[replicate_num].txt within ./epistasis_inference/ directory. In this example, the output file name is YAP1_epistasis_rep1.txt.
